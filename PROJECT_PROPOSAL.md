# Project Proposal Template

## Example Proposal Title

### 1. Abstract
This is where you will provide a brief outline of 5 - 10 sentences providing motivation to
this project. How does it fit into the overall BigMolecule AI narrative? Does it bring us closer to new breakthroughs in materials discovery or understanding and modeling molecular systems? Does it improve upon existing work? No need to mention datasets or models directly here yet, we’ll do that later. Focus on grand picture and why we should care about it. State what our hypothesis is.

### 2. Introduction and Prior Work
What literature on similar topics exists in the space if any? A few sentences for each. If any, how does our hypothesis fit into prior literature?

### 3. Deliverables
What do we plan to provide upon this projects completion? Datasets? APIs? Models? A paper? 

The best proposals will have all 4, but some might not be necessary. For instance, a proposal can just outline a model or a dataset without requiring a new API or a paper.

Proposals should only require a new API if absolutely necessary.

Every deliverable needs to be its own subsection. 


#### 3.1 Dataset
Approximately, what is the target size of the dataset we’ll produce? What will be the difficulty of collecting such a dataset? Do we need dedicated infrastructure? 

Do we intend to release the dataset? Optional, state the license if you're knowledgeable about the space? E.g. MIT license

#### 3.2 Model
Are we intending to release more than one model? 

What sizes are the models that we hope to release? Give a brief description of any architecture ideas, data required or interesting potential implementation details.


#### 3.3 API
What kind of API do we want to release, if applicable. Can we integrate it into an existing BigMolecule API? Can we integrate it into a non-BigMolecule API? What kind of documentation are we planning to write? Are we intending to release a documentation website? Do we have a design document? Are we prioritizing modularity or does our experiment not require that?


#### 3.4 Paper
Can our hypothesis be turned into a paper? What does the evaluation process for such a paper look like? Are we targeting any conferences? Can we release a blog post as well as the paper?

### 4 BigMolecule AI Impact
How does the completion of this project impact long term vision? 

Does this project open new avenues of exploration?

Is this project entering unchartered territory? Do we need subject matter experts we have not consulted before?

### 5 Broader Impacts

Discuss the broader impacts of this research as a whole. How is the project expected to positively impact materials or chemistry research at large?

Can it contribute to climate neutral products in the near term of in the future?

What kinds of risks, if any, are associated with this project as a whole?

### 6 Resources
What kinds of resources do we need to complete this project?

What kinds of resources (e.g. GPU hours, RAM, storage) are needed to complete the project?

What is a (rough) timeline for this project? Give a break down of ideal timelines. E.g We want to run X experiment by Y date and deliver Z milestone.


### 7 Expected Findings

What do we expect to find with this project? Are we aiming to disprove something? What
kinds of results would be interesting? What kinds of results would require us to pivot this
project? What kinds of results would require us to pivot other projects?

#### 7.1 Failure Case
If our findings are unsatisfactory, do we have deliverables along the way that we can still show?

#### 7.2 Reproducibility
Are our findings going to be easily reproducible? How can we maximize reproducibility?

Are there approaches, be it more resource intensive, that we can take to achieve a higher reproducibility? 

Are certain findings going to be more reproducible than others?

### 8 Preliminary Findings (optional)
If applicable, what findings have you seen that predict what kinds of results we’ll see. This
could be other literature or your own experiments. This should be multiple subsections,
potentially one for each probable outcome of the experiment. A risk analysis is beneficial
but not required.
